How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
    staging area is the space within which the files that user want to add to
    start version tracking is added before being committed. Files at the
    staging area are selected to be committed when the next commit action is
    taken.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    chunks that are related logically. Therefore allowing me to decide how
    to divide up the commits I will be doing into logical changes.
