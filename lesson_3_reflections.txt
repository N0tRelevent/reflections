When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - Keeping a copy in the cloud is always the safest option to reduce the risk
    of losing you work in case your hardware dies or get stolen or something

    convenient way of syncing your work
    - Cloud also makes it easy to share your work with the public
