When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - Keeping a copy in the cloud is always the safest option to reduce the risk
    of losing you work in case your hardware dies or get stolen or something
    like that.
    - If you are collaburating with other team members, the cloud will be a very
    convenient way of syncing your work
    - Cloud also makes it easy to share your work with the public

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - It gives me the freedom to only share my progress when I want to
    - I also get the opportunity to only push changes when a logical change
    is complete in case I wanted the cloud to only have complete logical
    chunks of the code
